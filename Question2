UNF: All data in one object:

   Projects(PersCode, PersName, DOB, LabCode, LabName, ResearchID, Description, Supervisor)

1NF: Split repeating and calculated groups and assign primary keys:
Since ResearchCode, Description and Supervisor are repeating, they are put in a seperate table. PersCode, LabCode and ResearchCode are unique numbers and therefore the best primary keys.

   Experiment(PersCode(PK), PersName, DOB, LabCode(PK), LabName, ResearchCode(PK))
   Research(ResearchCode(PK), Description, Supervisor)

2NF: Every non-prime attribute must be dependant wholely on the primary key:
Since PersName and DOB are only dependant on PersCode, these are set in a seperate table. 
Also LabName is only dependant on LabCode, so this is also put in a seperate table.

   Experiment(PersCode(PK), LabCode(PK), ResearchCode(PK))
   Pers(PersCode(PK), PersName, DOB)
   Lab(LabCode(PK), LabName)
   Research(ResearchCode(PK), Description, Supervisor)

3NF: Every non-prime attribute must be non-transitively dependent on every key
Same as 2NF, since the only 2 non-prime attributes in one table are Description and Supervisor and both are solely dependant on the LabCode.

   Experiment(PersCode(PK), LabCode(PK), ResearchCode(PK))
   Pers(PersCode(PK), PersName, DOB)
   Lab(LabCode(PK), LabName)
   Research(ResearchCode(PK), Description, Supervisor)
