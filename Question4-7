Question 4:
Give the name and length of the smallest gene in the genome.
    SELECT gene_name, min( seq_region_end - seq_region_start ) AS length FROM gene GROUP BY gene_name ORDER BY length limit 1;


Question 5:
What is the name of the gene with the most transcripts? What is the number of transcripts of this gene?
    SELECT count(*) AS transcripts, g.gene_name FROM transcript t JOIN gene g ON t.gene_id = g.gene_id  GROUP BY g.gene_name ORDER BY transcripts desc LIMIT 1;

Question 6:
Give the name of the chromosome with the second most genes that tell something about cancer. What is the number of exons of this chromosome? (2 queries) 
    SELECT chromosome, count(g.gene_name) as genes FROM gene g WHERE description LIKE "%cancer%" GROUP BY chromosome ORDER BY genes desc LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

    SELECT g.chromosome, count(e.exon_id) AS exons FROM gene g JOIN transcript t ON g.gene_id = t.gene_id 
        JOIN exon_transcript et ON t.transcript_id = et.transcript_id 
        JOIN exon e ON et.exon_id = e.exon_id 
        WHERE chromosome = 9 GROUP BY g.chromosome ORDER BY exons asc;

Question 7:
Give the number of rows from the exon table and do the same for the exon_transcript table. Explain why there is a difference in number of rows.
    SELECT count(*) FROM exon; -> 642590 rows
    SELECT count(*) FROM transcript; -> 178375 rows
    An exon can be transcribed starting from multiple locations, this is called alternative splicing. 
    That's why there are more exon entries than transcript entries, since each exon can be transcribed from multiple sites.
